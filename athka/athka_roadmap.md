# ATHKA Roadmap
## Programming (C++)
### Compiler
- CodeBlocks | Old & Lightweight
- Visual Studio Code | Customizable & Lightweight
- Visual Studio | Advanced & Heavy

Or you can use G++ directly in case of you like command line

### Learning
You don't need much knowledge in C++ like OOP, you just need to know:
- Input/Output (cin/cout)
- Loops
- Conditions
- Functions & Recursion
- Data types & Operations
- Bitwise Operations
- Basic Strings
- Structs (Optional)
- Pointers (Optional)

**Arabic:** [Harmash](https://harmash.com/tutorials/cplusplus/overview)
**English:** [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/)

Youtube & Google are your best friends in case of any problem, you can ask in communities.

**Expected Time: >2 weeks**

## Algorithms

- [Errichto Problems Sheet](https://codeforces.com/group/yg7WhsFsAp/contests)

**Expected Time: Forever**

## Notes
- Some problems need a specific algorithm, you may learn it or ignore the problem until you reach that level.
- Dynamic Programming really much depends on the amount of different DP problems you solved
