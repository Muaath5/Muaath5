# NOPAI Roadmap
## Programming (C++)
You don't need much knowledge in C++ like OOP, you just need to know:
- Input/Output
- Loops
- Conditions
- Functions & Recursion
- Data types & Operations
- Bitwise Operations
- Basic Strings
- Structs (Optional)

**Expected Time: >2 weeks**

## Algorithms
These are the important things to learn:
- Time/Memory Complexity
- Math Algorithms
  - Prime Test
  - Divisors
  - Prime Factorization
  - Goldbach Conjecture
  - Seive
  - GCD/LCM
- General Techniques & Algorithms
  - Binary Search
  - Two Pointers
  - Prefix Sum
- Graph Algorithms
  - DFS
  - BFS
  - Dijkstra
  - MST
- Data Strcutures
  - Queue
  - Stack
  - DSU
  - Segment Tree
  - Sqrt decomposition
- C++ Built-in Functions
  - `sort`
  - `lower_bound`/`upper_bound`/`binary_search`
  - `min`/`max`
  - `min_element`/`max_element`
  - `swap`
  - `reverse`
  - `builtin_popcount`
  - `memset`
  - `gcd`/`lcm`
- C++ Built-in Data Structures
  - `vector`
  - `set`/`multiset`/`unordered_set`
  - `map`
  - `pair`
  - `priority_queue`
  - `array`

## Practice
- Try an IOI Style Contests
- AtCoder & Codeforces are useful

**Expected Time: Forever**

## Notes
- Some problems need a specific algorithm, you may learn it or ignore the problem until you reach that level.
- Dynamic Programming really much depends on the amount of different DP problems you solved
